## üìã **Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (40 points)**
*Choose the best answer for each question. Each question is worth 2 points.*

### **Question 1: Core Terraform Workflow**
What is the correct order of Terraform's core workflow operations?

A) plan ‚Üí init ‚Üí apply ‚Üí destroy  
B) init ‚Üí validate ‚Üí plan ‚Üí apply  
C) init ‚Üí plan ‚Üí apply ‚Üí destroy  
D) validate ‚Üí init ‚Üí plan ‚Üí apply  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: The proper workflow is init (setup), validate (check syntax), plan (preview changes), then apply (execute changes).

---

### **Question 2: terraform init Purpose**
Which of the following is NOT performed during `terraform init`?

A) Download required providers  
B) Initialize backend configuration  
C) Create execution plan  
D) Set up the .terraform directory  

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: terraform init sets up the environment but does not create execution plans - that's done by terraform plan.

---

### **Question 3: Resource Lifecycle Meta-Arguments**
Which meta-argument prevents a resource from being destroyed accidentally?

A) `create_before_destroy = true`  
B) `prevent_destroy = true`  
C) `ignore_changes = []`  
D) `replace_triggered_by = []`  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: prevent_destroy = true in a lifecycle block prevents Terraform from destroying the resource.

---

### **Question 4: Implicit Dependencies**
How does Terraform automatically detect dependencies between resources?

A) Through resource naming conventions  
B) Through resource references in configuration  
C) Through explicit depends_on declarations  
D) Through provider configuration  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Terraform detects implicit dependencies when one resource references attributes of another resource.

---

### **Question 5: terraform plan Exit Codes**
When using `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode`, what does exit code 2 indicate?

A) Error occurred  
B) No changes needed  
C) Changes are present  
D) Plan saved successfully  

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: Exit code 2 indicates that changes are present in the plan, useful for automation and CI/CD.

---

### **Question 6: Resource Targeting**
What is the primary use case for `terraform apply -target=resource`?

A) Performance optimization  
B) Debugging and selective deployment  
C) Cost reduction  
D) Security enhancement  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Resource targeting is primarily used for debugging, testing, and selective deployment of specific resources.

---

### **Question 7: State Refresh**
When does Terraform automatically refresh the state?

A) During terraform init  
B) During terraform plan and apply  
C) During terraform destroy only  
D) Never automatically  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Terraform automatically refreshes state during plan and apply operations to detect drift.

---

### **Question 8: count vs for_each**
What is the main advantage of using `for_each` over `count` for creating multiple resources?

A) Better performance  
B) Lower cost  
C) Stable resource addresses  
D) Simpler syntax  

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: for_each provides stable resource addresses that don't change when items are added/removed from the middle.

---

### **Question 9: Parallelism Control**
What is the default parallelism level for Terraform operations?

A) 5  
B) 10  
C) 15  
D) 20  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Terraform's default parallelism is 10 concurrent operations.

---

### **Question 10: Error Recovery**
Which command should be used to unlock a stuck Terraform state?

A) `terraform refresh`  
B) `terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID`  
C) `terraform state rm`  
D) `terraform import`  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: terraform force-unlock with the lock ID is used to manually release a stuck state lock.

## üéØ **Section B: Scenario-Based Questions (30 points)**
*Analyze the scenarios and provide the best solutions. Each question is worth 10 points.*

### **Scenario 1: Resource Lifecycle Management Challenge (10 points)**

**Situation**: A development team needs to update their web application infrastructure. They have 5 EC2 instances running critical applications and need to upgrade the instance type from t3.micro to t3.small. However, they cannot afford any downtime during the upgrade process.

**Current Configuration**:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 5
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}
```

**Requirements**:
- Zero downtime during upgrade
- Maintain application availability
- Ensure proper dependency management
- Handle potential rollback scenarios

**Question**: Design a comprehensive lifecycle management strategy to safely upgrade the instances.

**Expected Answer Components**:

The infrastructure includes VPC, subnets, security groups, RDS database, ElastiCache cluster, EC2 instances, and an Application Load Balancer. Some dependencies are not automatically detected by Terraform.

**Deployment Requirements**:
1. VPC and networking must be created first
2. Database and cache must be available before application servers
3. Application servers must be healthy before load balancer configuration
4. Specific security group rules depend on external services
5. Some resources have circular dependency issues

**Question**: Design a dependency management strategy that ensures proper resource ordering and handles complex dependencies.

**Expected Answer Components**:
- Implicit dependency identification and usage
- Explicit depends_on configuration where needed
- Resource targeting strategy for phased deployment

**Situation**: A large infrastructure deployment with 200+ resources is experiencing performance issues and occasional failures. The team needs to optimize deployment time, handle partial failures gracefully, and implement robust error recovery procedures.

**Current Issues**:
- Terraform apply takes 45+ minutes to complete
- Frequent timeout errors with AWS API rate limits
- Partial apply failures leave infrastructure in inconsistent state
- State lock conflicts during team collaboration
- Difficulty troubleshooting specific resource failures

**Question**: Design a comprehensive performance optimization and error recovery strategy.

**Expected Answer Components**:
- Parallelism optimization and tuning
