### Domain Coverage

- **Domain 3**: Terraform Basics - 100%
- **Domain 6**: Terraform Workflow - 95%

## Key Concepts

### Terraform Lifecycle
1. **Write**: Create configuration files
2. **Init**: Initialize working directory
3. **Validate**: Check syntax
4. **Plan**: Preview changes
5. **Apply**: Make changes
6. **Destroy**: Remove infrastructure

### Key Commands
- `terraform init`: Initialize
- `terraform validate`: Validate syntax
- `terraform plan`: Preview changes
- `terraform apply`: Apply changes
- `terraform destroy`: Remove infrastructure

## Exam Tips

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 1**: `terraform validate` checks syntax, NOT AWS permissions.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 2**: Always review `terraform plan` output before applying.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 3**: Use `terraform plan -out=tfplan` to save plans for later review.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 4**: `terraform destroy` removes all managed resources.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 5**: Know the difference between `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Review Concept Material
Start with **Concept.md** to understand:
- Core Terraform operations
- Workflow best practices
- Command options and flags

### Step 2: Complete Labs
Follow **Lab-3.md** to:
- Initialize Terraform projects
- Validate configurations
- Generate and review plans
- Apply and destroy infrastructure

### Step 3: Test Your Knowledge
Complete **Test-Your-Understanding-Topic-3.md**:
- Answer multiple-choice questions
- Solve scenario-based problems
- Complete hands-on exercises

## Common Exam Questions

**Q: What does `terraform validate` check?**
A: Syntax and structure, NOT AWS permissions or resource availability.

**Q: What is the purpose of `terraform plan`?**
A: To preview what changes will be made without actually making them.

**Q: What is the difference between `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`?**
A: Plan shows changes; apply makes the changes.

**Q: Can you use `terraform apply` without running `terraform plan`?**
A: Yes, but it's not recommended. Always review the plan first.

## Best Practices

âœ… Always validate before planning  
âœ… Always review plan before applying  
âœ… Use `terraform plan -out=tfplan` to save plans  
âœ… Use `terraform apply tfplan` to apply saved plans  
âœ… Use `terraform destroy` carefully  
âœ… Keep configuration files organized  
âœ… Use version control for all files  

## Next Steps
