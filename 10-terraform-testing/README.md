## Certification Alignment

### Exam Objectives Covered

**Objective 3.1**: Terraform validation and formatting
- Know `terraform validate` command
- Understand `terraform fmt` usage
- Know when to use each command

**Objective 6.3**: Testing workflows
- Understand testing strategies
- Know testing frameworks
- Understand test organization

**Objective 6.4**: Quality assurance
- Know security scanning tools
- Understand policy as code
- Know CI/CD integration

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Review Concept Material
Start with **Concept.md** to understand:
- Terraform validation fundamentals
- Testing frameworks and tools
- Policy as Code concepts
- Security scanning practices

### Step 2: Generate Diagrams
```bash
cd DaC
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_all_diagrams.py
```

### Step 3: Complete Labs
Follow **Lab-10.md** to:
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Write Terratest tests
- Implement Sentinel policies
- Run security scans

### Step 4: Test Your Knowledge
Complete **Test-Your-Understanding-Topic-10.md**:
- Answer 12 multiple-choice questions
- Solve 3 scenario-based problems
- Complete 2 hands-on exercises

### Step 5: Practice with Code
Use **Terraform-Code-Lab-10.1/** to:
- Apply working Terraform configuration
- Practice validation commands
- Experiment with testing tools

## Key Concepts

### Terraform Validation
```bash
terraform validate  # Check syntax
terraform fmt       # Format code
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing Frameworks
- **Terratest**: Go-based testing
- **Kitchen-Terraform**: Test-Kitchen plugin
- **Sentinel**: HashiCorp policy language

### Security Scanning
- **tfsec**: Static analysis for security
- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code scanning
- **Terrascan**: Compliance violation detection

## Exam Tips

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 1**: `terraform validate` checks syntax, not AWS permissions  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 2**: `terraform fmt` is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 3**: Pre-commit hooks prevent bad code from being committed  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 4**: Terratest requires Go knowledge  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 5**: Sentinel is HashiCorp's policy language  

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Enforce Monitoring
Use Sentinel to require monitoring on all EC2 instances.

### Scenario 2: Prevent Bad Commits
Use pre-commit hooks to validate code before commits.

### Scenario 3: Security Compliance
Use tfsec and Checkov to scan for security issues.

## Best Practices

âœ… Always validate before commits  
âœ… Use pre-commit hooks to automate checks  
âœ… Write testable infrastructure code  
âœ… Implement security scanning  
âœ… Enforce policies with Sentinel  
âœ… Integrate testing into CI/CD  
âœ… Document compliance requirements  

## Next Steps
