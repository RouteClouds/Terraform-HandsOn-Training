# Comments and Notes:
#
# 1. Generated Diagrams Policy:
#    - All generated PNG/JPG/SVG diagrams should be committed
#    - These are essential assets for the training materials
#    - They provide visual learning aids that enhance comprehension
#
# 2. Development Environment:
#    - Virtual environments are excluded to prevent conflicts
#    - IDE configurations are excluded for developer flexibility
#    - Temporary files are excluded to keep repository clean
#
# 3. Security Considerations:
#    - No credentials or sensitive data should ever be committed
#    - Environment files with secrets are explicitly excluded
#    - Certificate and key files are blocked
#
# 4. Professional Standards:
#    - Log files are excluded but can be generated locally
#    - Testing artifacts are excluded except for essential results
#    - Documentation builds are excluded (source files are tracked)
#
# 5. Collaboration Guidelines:
#    - Platform-specific files are excluded for cross-platform compatibility
#    - Editor-specific configurations are excluded for team flexibility
#    - Backup files are excluded to prevent confusion
#
# For questions about this .gitignore configuration:
# - Review the AWS Terraform Training documentation
# - Consult the DaC implementation guide in README.md
# - Follow enterprise development standards and practices
