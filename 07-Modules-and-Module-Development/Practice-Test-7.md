## **Question 4** (Scenario-Based)
You're creating a VPC module that should work across different environments. Which approach is best for handling environment-specific configurations?

A) Create separate modules for each environment
B) Use conditional logic with variables
C) Hard-code production values
D) Use only default values

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: Using conditional logic with variables allows a single module to adapt to different environments while maintaining consistency.

---

## **Question 5** (Multiple Choice)
What is the correct syntax to call a module in Terraform?

A) `resource "module" "vpc" { source = "./modules/vpc" }`
B) `module "vpc" { source = "./modules/vpc" }`
C) `import "vpc" from "./modules/vpc"`
D) `include "./modules/vpc"`

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: The correct syntax uses the `module` block with a source parameter.

---

## **Question 6** (Multiple Choice)
Which meta-argument is commonly used in modules to create multiple similar resources?

A) depends_on
B) lifecycle
C) count
D) provider

**Answer: C**
**Explanation**: The `count` meta-argument is used to create multiple instances of resources based on a numeric value.

---

## **Question 7** (Multiple Select)
What should be included in a module's outputs.tf file? (Select all that apply)

A) Resource IDs that other modules might need
B) Computed values from resources
C) Sensitive information like passwords
D) Resource ARNs for cross-service integration
E) All variable values

**Answer: A, B, D**
**Explanation**: Outputs should expose useful values for consumption by other modules, but sensitive information should be marked as sensitive, and not all variables need to be output.

---

## **Question 8** (Scenario-Based)
Your module creates an RDS instance and you want to output the endpoint. However, the endpoint contains sensitive information. What's the best approach?

```hcl
output "db_endpoint" {
  value = aws_db_instance.main.endpoint
  # What should be added here?
}
```

A) `description = "Database endpoint"`
B) `sensitive = true`
C) `type = string`
D) Nothing additional needed

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: The `sensitive = true` attribute prevents the output value from being displayed in logs and console output.

---

## **Question 9** (Multiple Choice)
What is the purpose of the versions.tf file in a module?

A) To track module version history
B) To specify required Terraform and provider versions
C) To define variable versions
D) To manage resource versions

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: The versions.tf file specifies the minimum required versions of Terraform and providers for the module to function correctly.

## **Question 10** (Multiple Choice)
Which validation block would correctly validate that a variable contains a valid AWS region?

A) 
```hcl
validation {
  condition = length(var.region) > 0
  error_message = "Region cannot be empty."
}
```

B)
```hcl
validation {
  condition = can(regex("^[a-z]{2}-[a-z]+-[0-9]$", var.region))
  error_message = "Must be a valid AWS region format."
}
```

C)
```hcl
validation {
  condition = var.region == "us-east-1"
  error_message = "Only us-east-1 is allowed."
}
```

D)
```hcl
validation {
  condition = contains(["us-east-1", "us-west-2"], var.region)
  error_message = "Invalid region."
}
```

**Answer: B**
**Explanation**: Option B uses a regex pattern that matches the AWS region naming convention (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1).

---

## **Question 11** (Scenario-Based)
You have a module that creates different numbers of subnets based on the environment. Which approach is most appropriate?

A) Use count with a variable
B) Create separate resources for each environment
C) Use for_each with a map
