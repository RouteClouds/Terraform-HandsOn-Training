## üìö Usage Guidelines

### In Presentations
- Use diagrams at full resolution for crisp display
- Maintain aspect ratios when resizing
- Ensure adequate contrast for projection environments
- Consider accessibility requirements for color-blind viewers

### In Documentation
- Reference diagrams by figure number and title
- Provide context before introducing each diagram
- Use diagrams to support, not replace, textual explanations
- Include alternative text descriptions for accessibility

### In Training Materials
- Introduce diagrams progressively to build understanding
- Use diagrams as visual anchors for complex concepts
- Encourage learners to trace through workflows visually
- Provide hands-on exercises that map to diagram components

## üõ†Ô∏è Regeneration Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Python environment is set up
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

# Verify Graphviz installation
dot -V
```

### Generate All Diagrams
```bash
# From the DaC directory
cd ..
python diagram_generation_script.py
```

### Generate Individual Diagrams
Modify the `main()` function in `diagram_generation_script.py` to include only specific diagrams:

```python
# Example: Generate only Figure 7.1
diagrams = [
    ("Figure 7.1: Module Architecture Patterns", create_module_architecture_patterns),
]
```

## üìà Quality Metrics

### File Specifications
- **Average File Size**: 400-600 KB per diagram
- **Dimensions**: Optimized for 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios
- **Compression**: Balanced for quality and file size
- **Transparency**: Maintained for flexible backgrounds

### Accessibility Compliance
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
