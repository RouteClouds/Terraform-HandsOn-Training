## Overview

Topic 1 covers the foundational concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its integration with AWS. This is critical for understanding why Terraform exists and how it fits into the broader infrastructure management landscape.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this topic, you will be able to:

âœ… Define Infrastructure as Code and explain its core principles  
âœ… Describe the advantages of IaC over traditional infrastructure management  
âœ… Explain Terraform's use cases and capabilities  
âœ… Distinguish between different IaC tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK)  
âœ… Understand AWS integration with IaC tools  
âœ… Analyze business value and ROI of IaC adoption

### Domain Coverage

- **Domain 1**: IaC Concepts - 100% âœ…

## Key Concepts

### Infrastructure as Code
Treating infrastructure like software code with version control, testing, and automation.

### Core Principles
1. **Declarative**: Define desired state, not steps
2. **Version Control**: Track all changes
3. **Idempotent**: Same result every time
4. **Immutable**: Replace, don't modify
5. **Automated**: Eliminate manual work

### IaC Benefits
- Consistency across environments
- Faster deployments
- Easier disaster recovery
- Cost optimization
- Improved security
- Better collaboration

## Exam Tips

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 1**: IaC is about treating infrastructure like code. Know the core principles.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 2**: The exam tests your understanding of IaC benefits. Be able to explain each one.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 3**: Know the differences between Terraform, CloudFormation, and CDK.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 4**: Understand why organizations adopt IaC (business value, ROI).

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 5**: Be familiar with AWS services that support IaC (CloudFormation, CDK, Systems Manager).

## Common Exam Questions

**Q: What is Infrastructure as Code?**
A: Treating infrastructure like software code with version control, testing, and automation.

**Q: What are the advantages of IaC?**
A: Consistency, repeatability, version control, automation, cost optimization, improved security.

**Q: How does Terraform differ from CloudFormation?**
A: Terraform is multi-cloud and uses HCL, while CloudFormation is AWS-only and uses JSON/YAML.

**Q: What is idempotency in IaC?**
A: Running the same code multiple times produces the same result.

## Best Practices

âœ… Treat infrastructure like code  
âœ… Use version control for all infrastructure  
âœ… Implement code review processes  
âœ… Test infrastructure changes  
âœ… Document infrastructure decisions  
âœ… Automate infrastructure provisioning  
âœ… Monitor and audit infrastructure changes
