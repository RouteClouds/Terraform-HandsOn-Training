## 📚 **Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (25 points)**

### **Question 1** (3 points)
Which AWS services are required for a complete Terraform remote backend with state locking?

A) S3 and CloudWatch  
B) S3 and DynamoDB  
C) DynamoDB and RDS  
D) S3, DynamoDB, and Lambda  

**Answer**: B) S3 and DynamoDB

**Explanation**: S3 provides state storage while DynamoDB provides state locking mechanism. CloudWatch, RDS, and Lambda are not required for basic backend functionality.

---

### **Question 2** (3 points)
What is the primary key attribute name required for a DynamoDB table used for Terraform state locking?

A) `StateID`  
B) `LockID`  
C) `TerraformLock`  
D) `ID`  

**Answer**: B) `LockID`

**Explanation**: Terraform specifically requires the DynamoDB table to have a primary key named `LockID` of type String for state locking functionality.

---

### **Question 3** (4 points)
Which backend configuration parameter enables workspace-based state file organization in S3?

A) `workspace_enabled`  
B) `workspace_key_prefix`  
C) `workspace_isolation`  
D) `multi_workspace`  

**Answer**: B) `workspace_key_prefix`

**Explanation**: The `workspace_key_prefix` parameter allows Terraform to organize state files by workspace, creating paths like `env:/workspace-name/terraform.tfstate`.

---

### **Question 4** (4 points)
What happens when two users simultaneously run `terraform apply` with proper state locking configured?

A) Both operations proceed simultaneously  
B) The second operation waits for the first to complete  
C) The second operation fails immediately  
D) Terraform merges the changes automatically  

**Answer**: B) The second operation waits for the first to complete

**Explanation**: With proper state locking, Terraform will wait for the lock to be released before proceeding with the second operation, preventing state corruption.

---

### **Question 5** (3 points)
Which encryption option provides the highest level of security for Terraform state files in S3?

A) No encryption  
B) AES256 (SSE-S3)  
C) aws:kms (SSE-KMS) with customer-managed keys  
D) Client-side encryption  

**Answer**: C) aws:kms (SSE-KMS) with customer-managed keys

**Explanation**: Customer-managed KMS keys provide the highest level of control and security, including key rotation, access policies, and audit trails.

---

### **Question 6** (4 points)
What is the recommended approach for handling sensitive data in Terraform state files?

A) Store sensitive data directly in state files  
B) Use separate backends for sensitive resources  
C) Avoid storing sensitive data in state; use external secret management  
D) Encrypt the entire state file with GPG  

**Answer**: C) Avoid storing sensitive data in state; use external secret management

**Explanation**: Best practice is to avoid storing sensitive data in state files and instead use AWS Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, or similar services.

---

### **Question 7** (4 points)
Which command is used to migrate state from a local backend to a remote S3 backend?

A) `terraform init -migrate-state`  
B) `terraform state migrate`  
C) `terraform backend migrate`  
D) `terraform init -reconfigure`  

**Answer**: A) `terraform init -migrate-state`

**Explanation**: The `-migrate-state` flag during `terraform init` safely migrates existing state to the newly configured backend.
