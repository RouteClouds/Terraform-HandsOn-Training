## Key Concepts

### State File
- Maps configuration to real resources
- Contains sensitive data
- Must be protected
- Should use remote backend

### Remote Backends
- S3 with DynamoDB locking
- Terraform Cloud
- Terraform Enterprise
- Other backends (Azure, GCP, etc.)

### State Locking
- Prevents concurrent modifications
- Uses DynamoDB for AWS
- Prevents state corruption

## Exam Tips

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 1**: Never commit state files to Git.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 2**: Always use remote backends in production.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 3**: Enable state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

## Common Exam Questions

**Q: What is the Terraform state file?**
A: A file that maps your configuration to real AWS resources.

**Q: Should you commit state files to Git?**
A: No, never. State files contain sensitive data.

**Q: What is state locking?**
A: A mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications to state.

**Q: How do you implement state locking with S3?**
A: Use DynamoDB table for locking.

## Best Practices

âœ… Never commit state files to Git  
âœ… Always use remote backends in production  
âœ… Enable state locking  
âœ… Encrypt state files  
âœ… Implement backup strategies  
âœ… Use state file versioning  
âœ… Restrict state file access  

## Next Steps
