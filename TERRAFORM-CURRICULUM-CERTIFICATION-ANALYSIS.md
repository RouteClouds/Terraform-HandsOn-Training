## GAP ANALYSIS

### Minor Gaps Identified

#### 1. **HCP Terraform Sentinel Policies** (Domain 9b)
**Gap**: Limited coverage of Sentinel policy language and enforcement

**Current Coverage**: 
- Topic 12 mentions Sentinel
- Projects 3, 5 reference policy enforcement

**Recommendation**: 
- Add 1-2 sections to Topic 12 on Sentinel policy syntax
- Create example Sentinel policies in capstone projects
- Add practice questions on policy evaluation

**Impact**: Low (5-10% of exam questions)

#### 2. **HCP Terraform Teams & Permissions** (Domain 9b)
**Gap**: Limited hands-on examples of team management

**Current Coverage**:
- Topic 12 covers concepts
- No practical lab exercises

**Recommendation**:
- Add lab exercise for team creation and permission management
- Include role-based access control (RBAC) examples
- Add scenario-based questions

**Impact**: Low (3-5% of exam questions)

#### 3. **Terraform Cloud VCS Integration** (Domain 9a)
**Gap**: Limited coverage of VCS workflows

**Current Coverage**:
- Topic 12 mentions VCS integration
- Project 3 has CI/CD but not VCS-specific

**Recommendation**:
- Add section on GitHub/GitLab integration
- Include webhook configuration examples
- Add lab for VCS-triggered runs

**Impact**: Low (2-3% of exam questions)
