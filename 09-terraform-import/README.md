## Certification Alignment

### Exam Objectives Covered

**Objective 4.1**: Import resources into Terraform state
- Know `terraform import` command syntax
- Understand resource address format
- Be able to import common AWS resources

**Objective 4.4**: Manage state with terraform state commands
- Know `terraform state` subcommands
- Understand `state rm`, `state mv`, `state show`
- Be able to manipulate state safely

**Objective 4.5**: Understand when to use terraform taint/untaint
- Know difference between `taint` and `untaint`

- Know when to use state manipulation vs. taint

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Review Concept Material
Start with **Concept.md** to understand:
- Terraform import fundamentals
- State file structure
- State manipulation commands
- Best practices and patterns

### Step 2: Generate Diagrams
```bash
cd DaC
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_all_diagrams.py
```

### Step 3: Complete Labs
Follow **Lab-9.md** to:
- Import an EC2 instance
- Migrate resources between state files
- Recover from state corruption

### Step 4: Test Your Knowledge
Complete **Test-Your-Understanding-Topic-9.md**:
- Answer 10 multiple-choice questions
- Solve 3 scenario-based problems
- Complete 2 hands-on exercises

### Step 5: Practice with Code
Use **Terraform-Code-Lab-9.1/** to:
- Apply working Terraform configuration
- Practice import commands
- Experiment with state manipulation

## Key Concepts

### Terraform Import
```bash
terraform import aws_instance.web i-1234567890abcdef0
```
Brings existing AWS resources into Terraform state.

### State Manipulation
```bash
terraform state list              # List resources
terraform state show aws_instance.web  # Show details
terraform state rm aws_instance.web    # Remove from state
terraform state mv old_name new_name   # Rename resource
```

### Resource Targeting
```bash
terraform plan -target=aws_instance.web
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.web
```

### Backup and Recovery
```bash
cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup
cp terraform.tfstate.backup terraform.tfstate
terraform refresh
```

## Exam Tips

ðŸ’¡ **Tip 1**: Import requires matching resource configuration  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 2**: Always backup state before manipulation  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 3**: Use `terraform plan` to verify after import  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 4**: Resource targeting is useful for large deployments  
ðŸ’¡ **Tip 5**: State commands are powerful but use carefully  

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Migrate Existing Infrastructure
1. Write Terraform configuration
2. Import resources with `terraform import`
3. Verify with `terraform plan`
4. Commit to version control

### Scenario 2: Consolidate Multiple State Files
1. Use `terraform state mv` to move resources
2. Switch between workspaces
3. Verify resources in new location
4. Clean up old state

### Scenario 3: Disaster Recovery
1. Restore from backup: `cp .backup terraform.tfstate`
2. Refresh state: `terraform refresh`
3. Verify with `terraform plan`
4. Commit recovery

## Best Practices

âœ… Always backup state before manipulation  
âœ… Use remote state for team environments  
âœ… Enable state locking for collaboration  
âœ… Test import procedures in non-production first  
âœ… Document import procedures  
âœ… Version control your Terraform code  
âœ… Use `terraform plan` to verify changes  
âœ… Implement disaster recovery procedures  

## Troubleshooting

**Q: "Resource already exists in state"**  
A: Use `terraform state rm` to remove it first

**Q: "Resource not found in AWS"**  
A: Verify resource ID with AWS CLI

**Q: "State file corrupted"**  
A: Restore from `.backup` file and refresh

## Next Steps

After completing Topic 9:
1. Review certification exam objectives 4.1, 4.4, 4.5
2. Practice import scenarios with real resources
3. Proceed to **Topic 10**: Terraform Testing & Validation
4. Continue with remaining topics for full certification prep
